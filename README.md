# LeafletJS-HTML-Demo

An example project showcasing the integration of LeafletJS library into HTML to create interactive maps.

## Getting Started

To use this demo, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/LeafletJS-HTML-Demo.git`


2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

The browser should display a map centered on a specific location.

## Customizing the Map

To customize the map or add additional functionality, you can modify the JavaScript code in the `index.html` file.

- To change the initial view and zoom level, modify the `setView` function parameters in the following line:
`var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);`

- To add markers, polygons, or other layers to the map, refer to the Leaflet documentation and examples: [Leaflet Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html)
